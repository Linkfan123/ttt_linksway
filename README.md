# ttt_linksway
A modification to ttt_67thway(\_v13?) to hopefully improve the map even further.

##Note
This is a VERY old project that has not been worked on in 6 freakin' years. Don't expect anything to actually get done.

## (planned) Features:
- Done: ~~Add stairs to the main entryway into the underground~~ Decided not to do that but instead make another ladder
- Done: Make one of the farm houses bigger  
- In Progress: Make the sniper spot in the farm bigger  
- In Progress: Make athstetic changes to "realitize" atmosphere
- Other general improvements
